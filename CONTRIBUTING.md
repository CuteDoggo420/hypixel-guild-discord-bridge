## Development

### Setting up environment

Clone the project and install dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aidn3/hypixel-guild-discord-bridge.git
cd hypixel-guild-discord-bridge
npm install
```

> It is recommended that you use an IDE that manages the linter and compiler for you.

### Committing changes

After done with changes, make sure to run `npm run validate` to validate all changes
and ensure they are fully compatible with the project as a whole.
