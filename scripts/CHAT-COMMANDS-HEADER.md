These commands can be executed from any chat channel the application can see.
This includes guild/officer chat as well as private `/msg` and Discord direct messaging channels.

Most [Soopy commands](https://soopy.dev/commands) are supported and can be used by executing `!soopy rtca`.
A shorter version can also be used: `!- rtca`
